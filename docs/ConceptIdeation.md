title: Ideation and Concept Generation

## Our Goal

The goal of our exhibit is to provide an enjoyable and informative experience about a particular concept from the STEM field. Through this exhibit, users will be able to directly interact with the display to change or show an observable scientific phenomenon. To be both entertaining and memorable, this exhibit will be designed to be a simple game where the user will be able to see how they can manipulate the display to get closer to a specified goal.

Our target audience for this exhibit will primarily be for students in the grades K-12. This exhibit will be tailored to students that are interested in any category of STEM related subjects. 
## Brainstorm Session

Our top two ideas detailed in this organization were the guitar tuner and decibel balance, which we turned into one exhibit. This exhibit was a game where a user sings a certain frequency for an amount of time before the frequency range changes and the actuator moves forward. If the actuator moves forward enough to push the button, the user wins the game.

We originally threw random ideas at the wall without considering too much if they were in the scope of this class or exemplifying a certain STEM principle, but as the process went on we were able to hone in on a some relevant ideas. As we approached a sufficient amount of sticky notes, we began grouping them by what would fit into a holistic design rather than just keeping them as singular ideas. From this came more thoughtful and fleshed out ideas. Although a lot of the ideas themselves were fun, we found it hard to find a whole concept within our sticky notes that would be interesting design wise as well as explicitly lay out a STEM principle. From this we decided to rank them both by design criteria as well as functionality as a science exhibit exemplifying a certain STEM principle.

## Rationale

The features highlighted in our design include concepts such as value recording, simple controls, and visual feedback. Users will try to match a random value for a certain amount of time until the value range changes and an actuator moves forward. The actuator moves forward to a button that signals to the user that they have won the game. Features that are provided to make use of the device easier is a display showing what number the user must try to match their value to in order to move forward aswell as LEDs that act as aditional progress indicators for the user. Controls will be two pushbuttons so that they can increase and decrease their stored number as well as start and reset the game. The game will be comfortable and safe to play as the user will be interacting with very simple controls and not be interacting with any potentially dangerous circuitry. The instructions needed for the exhibit will be explained on the digital display. The exhibit is simple enough so that most of its use will be intuitive. The design has changed a couple times over the course of development due to team and assebly issues. While not able to stick with the previous concepts for the exhibit, the general basis for functionality and the overall design for it to be a "minigame" remained fairly consistent. Previous versions of these concepts for the project can be found in the appendix.

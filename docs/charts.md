##Communication

###Comunication Channels

Name | First Choice Communication | Second Choice Communication | Third Choice Communication
-----|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------
Jack Francis | Text | Google Meet | Discord
Shane Duttenhefner | Text | Discord | Google Meet
Luke Jeffs | Text | Discord | Google Meet

###Communication Procedure
Our team will primarily communicate through text and will use either Discord or Google Meet for calling one another in order to start meetings or discuss complicated topics. For instructor correspondence, the team will all share equal responsibility so e can all be on the same page and aware of any new information.

###Meeting Schedule
Our group will meet up in person or in call to work on projects during the following times:
-Tues/Thurs: 1:30pm-3:00pm
-Saturday: 2:00pm-5:00pm

### Meeting Coordination
We will remind ourselves of meetings the day of by texting eachother in advance. If we need to change or add meeting times by communicating with one another about ideal times and try to come to an agreed time. For now, our preffered format for meeting is virtual, but as we move to making our physical boards, we may prefer face to face. Another procedure we feel is necessary is that each member should make sure to inform the others about missing meetings as earlier as possible.

## Rationale

Our device is catered to K-12 audiences interested in learning about STEM. The features highlighted in our design include concepts such as value recording and frequency, made easy to discern by the simple game mechanics showing how a device is able to recognize frequency. Users will try to replicate a frequency for a certain amount of time until the frequency range changes and an actuator moves forward. The actuator moves forward to a button that signals to the user that they have won the game. The game uses progressive difficulty levels as acceptable frequencies get narrower and narrower. Cues provided to make use of the device easier is a display showing what frequencies are acceptable and unacceptable to move forward. Controls will be the user's own voice as they aim to replicate the frequency they are designated by the display. The game will be comfortable and safe to play as the user will just be speaking at a mild volume into a microphone in order to play the game. The instructions needed for the exhibit will be explained in simple and concise bullet points. The exhibit is simple enough so that most of its use will be intuitive.

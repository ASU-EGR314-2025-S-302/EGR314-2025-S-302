title: Ideation and Concept Generation

## Our Goal

The goal of our exhibit is to provide an enjoyable and informative experience about a particular concept from the STEM field. Through this exhibit, users will be able to directly interact with the display to change or show an observable scientific phenomenon. To be both entertaining and memorable, this exhibit will be designed to be a simple game where the user will be able to see how they can manipulate the display to get closer to a specified goal.
Our target audience for this exhibit will primarily be for students in the grades K-12. This exhibit will be tailored to the particular students that are interested in any category of STEM related subjects. It could also interest those with a musical background and show them the overlaps between auditorial concepts and STEM concepts.

## Brainstorm Session

Our top two ideas, the guitar tuner and decibel balance, were turned into one exhibit. A game where a user sings a certain frequency for a certain time before the frequency range changes and the actuator moves forward. If the actuator moves forward enough to push the button, the user wins the game.

## Rationale

The features highlighted in our design include concepts such as value recording and frequency, made easy to discern by the simple game mechanics showing how a device is able to recognize frequency. Users will try to replicate a frequency for a certain amount of time until the frequency range changes and an actuator moves forward. The actuator moves forward to a button that signals to the user that they have won the game. The game uses progressive difficulty levels as acceptable frequencies get narrower and narrower. Cues provided to make use of the device easier is a display showing what frequencies are acceptable and unacceptable to move forward. Controls will be the user's own voice as they aim to replicate the frequency they are designated by the display. The game will be comfortable and safe to play as the user will just be speaking at a mild volume into a microphone in order to play the game. The instructions needed for the exhibit will be explained in simple and concise bullet points. The exhibit is simple enough so that most of its use will be intuitive.

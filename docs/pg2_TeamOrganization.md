##Team Charter statement
>Our objective is to work as a team and design a set of individual circuit boards that can communicate with each other via UART to create a museum-like exhibit that a user can interact with.

##Product Mission Statement
>Our goal is to provide a simple and fun game for students in grades K-6 that demonstrates how hardware can be used to interact with digital systems.


##Communication

###Comunication Channels

**Name** | **First Choice Communication** | **Second Choice Communication** | **Third Choice Communication**
---------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------
Jack Francis | Text | Google Meet | Discord
Shane Duttenhefner | Text | Discord | Google Meet

###Communication Procedure

Our team will primarily communicate through text and will use either Discord or Google Meet for calling one another in order to start meetings or discuss complicated topics. For instructor correspondence, the team will all share equal responsibility so we can all be on the same page and aware of any new information.

###Meeting Schedule

Our group will meet up in person or in call to work on projects during the following times:

- Tues/Thurs: 1:30pm-3:00pm

- Saturday: 2:00pm-5:00pm

### Meeting Coordination

We will remind ourselves of meetings the day of by texting each other in advance. If we need to change or add meeting times by communicating with one another about ideal times and try to come to an agreed time. For now, our preferred format for meeting is virtual, but as we move to making our physical boards, we will meet face to face. Another procedure we feel is necessary is that each member should make sure to inform the others about missing meetings as earlier as possible.

###Roles and Responsibilities

**Roles** | **Member** | **Duties**
----------|------------|-----------
Meeting Leader | Jack Francis | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting
Assignment Leader | Shane Duttenhefner | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date
Project Monitor | Luke Jeffs | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status

### Team Coordination and Accountability

We will ensure that assignments are submitted on time with approval from every member by staying in constant communication about where we are in the project and informing each other of our individual contributions or edits. We will ask each other about what we know and what we struggle with for each assignment and if a member lacks the knowledge or skill for an assignment, the others will do their best to help and if they cannot, we will seek external aid via professors, other classmates, or the internet. To make sure everyone understands and acts upon the design review feedback, we will each take the time to read the provided feedback and talk to each other about how we can all improve in any possible areas. When addressing missed contribution or recognizing underperformance, the team will solve this by talking to the underperforming member and see what the issue is and see if we can come to an understanding to improve each other's teamwork.

### Conflict Recognition and Resolution

When conflict arises in our group, our first step is to communicate about what is causing this to happen and try to resolve it by either coming up with a compromise that everyone can agree on or change the way we organize ourselves in a way that benefits everyone. The problem should only be escalated to the instructor when the member causing problems refuses to cooperate and is actively hindering the rest of the team from completing our work.

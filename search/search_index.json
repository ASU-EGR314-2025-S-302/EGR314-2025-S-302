Users will try to replicate a frequency for a certain amount of time until the frequency range changes and an actuator moves forward. The actuator moves forward to a button that signals to the user that they have won the game. The game uses progressive difficulty levels as acceptable frequencies get narrower and narrower. Cues provided to make use of the device easier is a display showing what frequencies are acceptable and unacceptable to move forward. Controls will be the user's own voice as they aim to replicate the frequency they are designated by the display. The game will be comfortable and safe to play as the user will just be speaking at a mild volume into a microphone in order to play the game. The instructions needed for the exhibit will be explained in simple and concise bullet points.

It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily.
